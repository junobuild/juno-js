/**
 * Uploads a Satellite WASM file to the CDN as part of a proposal-based deployment.
 *
 * This function:
 * 1. Optionally performs a memory check (via `assertMemory`).
 * 2. Packages the WASM file into the required format.
 * 3. Uploads the file(s) using the provided upload function â€” which may
 *    perform a batched proposal flow or an individual file flow, depending
 *    on the `upload` implementation.
 * 4. Submits a proposal to deploy the uploaded Satellite WASM.
 * 5. Optionally commits (applies) the proposal if `autoCommit` is `true`.
 *
 * @param {Object} options - The deployment and proposal configuration.
 * @param {PublishSatelliteWasmParams} options.publish - Publication parameters including the upload function,
 * memory assertion, and file paths.
 * @param {Object} options.proposal - Proposal options.
 * @param {CdnParameters} options.proposal.cdn - CDN and governance configuration.
 * @param {boolean} options.proposal.autoCommit - If `true`, the proposal is automatically committed after submission.
 * @param {string} options.proposal.version - The Satellite version to include in the proposal.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<DeployResultWithProposal>} A result object describing the outcome:
 * - `{ result: 'skipped' }` â€“ No files were found to upload.
 * - `{ result: 'submitted', files, proposalId }` â€“ Upload and proposal submission succeeded.
 * - `{ result: 'deployed', files, proposalId }` â€“ Upload succeeded and proposal was auto-committed.
