/**
 * Uploads a Satellite WASM file to the CDN as part of a proposal-based deployment.
 *
 * This function performs a memory check (if provided), packages the WASM file,
 * uploads it to the CDN, and submits a proposal for deployment.
 * Optionally, the proposal can be auto-committed if `autoCommit` is true.
 *
 * @param {Object} options - The deployment and proposal configuration.
 * @param {PublishSatelliteWasmParams} options.deploy - Deployment parameters including the upload function, memory assertion, and file paths.
 * @param {Object} options.proposal - Proposal options.
 * @param {CdnParameters} options.proposal.cdn - CDN and governance configuration.
 * @param {boolean} options.proposal.autoCommit - If `true`, the proposal is automatically committed after submission.
 * @param {string} options.proposal.version - The Satellite version to include in the proposal.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<DeployResultWithProposal>} A result object describing the outcome:
 * - `{ result: 'skipped' }` â€“ No files were found to upload.
 * - `{ result: 'submitted', files, proposalId }` â€“ Upload and proposal submission succeeded.
 * - `{ result: 'deployed', files, proposalId }` â€“ Upload succeeded and proposal was auto-committed.
