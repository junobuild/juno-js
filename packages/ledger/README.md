# Juno JavaScript ledger fork

A lightweight fork of [@dfinity/nns](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/nns), this version includes only the essential components, such as the `AccountIdentifier`, utilized in the Juno console to reduce the bundle size.

Additionally, it has been enhanced to support calling balance and listing transactions through the ICP Index canister.
