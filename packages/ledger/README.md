# Juno JavaScript core SDK

A library used by [Juno] to interact with the ledger of the Internet Computer.

## Fork

This library is a fork of [@dfinity/nns](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/nns) that uses only the required parts of the library dedicated to the ledger used in [Juno] console in order to reduce the bundle size.

It also uses various features of [@dfinity/ledger](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/ledger).
